# Image-Visualization
<h2>Objective :</h2>
This repository demonstrates how to effectively visualize images using the Python Imaging Library (PIL), NumPy, and Matplotlib. It covers a range of image manipulation and visualization tasks, making it a valuable resource for data scientists, computer vision engineers, and anyone working with image data.
<h3>Libraries :</h3>
<p><strong>NumPy :</strong>For numerical computations and array operations.</p>
<p><strong>Matplotlib :</strong> For visualization by images or interactive plots showcasing the results.</p>
<p><strong>PIL :</strong>Python Imaging Library (PIL) for image loading and manipulation</p>
